Notes:
  - It was difficult to get the data for this project. It was scattered in various places. 
  - I couldn't find the full population data for East Cheshire so I had to use a basic formula to estimate it myself.
  - I improved my ability to import data from CSV files and sort the data using power query editor.
  - I learn when to unpivot tables and when to transpose them. The dates were on the wrong axis.
  - I merged data from two sources using the query editor. This was data for male and female life expectancy.
  - I used the append queries option to add data to the educational achievement table. It didn't have the data for the whole of England at first.
  - Overall it was a humbling and enjoyable experience. I came across many issues and I learnt how to get around them. Doing your own projects is the best way to learn.
